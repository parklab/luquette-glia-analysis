Donor ID 190106 shows up as either CON1901106 (donor ID) or CON11901106 (for single cells).
These typos were corrected after processing, but remain in the metadata files here.

"CON" prefixes for both donor and sample IDs are internal only and were removed post-analysis.

"UMB" prefixes are applicable to all donor IDs except 190106 and 301159, but only appear on
a subset of donors in the metadata supplied here. When referred to in most text and figures,
the "UMB" prefixes are dropped for brevity.
